// Use filter method to create two arrays, one for Batman's gadgets and one for CatWoman's
// Hint: Use filter to filter objects based on the 'owner' property

// Use map method to transform arrays into arrays of gadget names (strings)
// Hint: Use map to extract the 'name' property from each object
