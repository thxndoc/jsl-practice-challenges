// In this code:

// - The `Customer` class represents a bank customer and encapsulates their name, account number (private), and account balance.
// - `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `displayBalance` methods perform operations on the account balance.
// - `_accountNumber` is a private field, and `getAccountNumber` is a getter method to access it from outside the class.
// - We create a `customer1` object and test the methods, including accessing the private account number through the getter method.
